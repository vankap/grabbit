== Monitoring/Validation Content Sync

You may choose to use grabbit.sh to monitor your sync, or you can validate/monitor your sync by going to the following URIs:

`/grabbit/job/<jobId>`
`/grabbit/transaction/<transactionId>`

A job status has the following format :

```json
 {
       "endTime": "Timestamp",
       "exitStatus": {
           "exitCode": "Code",
           "exitDescription": "",
           "running": "true/false"
       },
       "jcrNodesWritten": "#OfNodes",
       "jobExecutionId": "JobExecutionId",
       "path": "currentPath",
       "startTime": "TimeStamp",
       "timeTaken": "TimeInMilliSeconds",
       "transactionId": "transactionId"
   }
```

Couple of points worth noting here:
`"exitCode"` can have 4 states - `UNKNOWN`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `VALIDATION_FAILED`. `UNKNOWN` means the job is still running. `COMPLETED` means that the job was completed successfully. `FAILED` means the job failed. `VALIDATION_FAILED` means the job was aborted due to configuration; This could mean that although the configuration was valid, Grabbit refused to sync a path - for e.g, a non-existing parent path. Grabbit will not implicitly write parent nodes.
`"jcrNodesWritten"` : This indicates how many nodes are currently written (increments by 1000)
`"timeTaken"` : This will indicate the total time taken to complete content grab for `currentPath`

If `exitCode` returns as `UNKNOWN`, that means the job is still running and you should check for its status again.

Two loggers are predefined for Grabbit. One detailing content receive operations, another for content push operations.
They are link:../src/main/content/SLING-INF/content/apps/grabbit/config/org.apache.sling.commons.log.LogManager.factory.config-com.twcable.grabbit.send.xml[grabbit-send.log] and link:../src/main/content/SLING-INF/content/apps/grabbit/config/org.apache.sling.commons.log.LogManager.factory.config-com.twcable.grabbit.receive.xml[grabbit-receive.log] respectively.
These log files are for anything logged in **com.twcable.grabbit.server** and **com.twcable.grabbit.client** packages.

If you want to see what nodes are being written to a receiving server, change the logging for `grabbit-receive.log` above to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.
